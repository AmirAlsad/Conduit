//  Why a call ended in `.failed`. Drives the spoken/visible state and how the
//  log row reads. `badToken` (auth) is distinct from `lostConnection` (a
//  recoverable drop whose reconnection budget was exhausted) so the two never
//  get conflated — one is a desk-time fix, the other a road condition.
