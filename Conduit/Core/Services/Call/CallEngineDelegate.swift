//  The host's side of the call engine: it resolves incoming targets, observes
//  state transitions (spoken cues, Siri donation), records finished calls, and
//  supplies the bearer for ring-status receipts. Every call is synchronous and on
//  the main actor, in the order the engine makes the change, so a host sees each
//  transition in the same turn as the state assignment.
