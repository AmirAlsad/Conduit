//  AudioInterruptionObserving.swift
//  Conduit
//
//  Observes AVAudioSession interruptions (Siri, a real phone call, a navigation
//  takeover) during a live call. CallKit owns the session; this only *reports*
//  begin/end so the coordinator can pause the mic and resume cleanly — it never
//  touches the session itself. The real implementation wraps the interruption
//  notification; the fake drives the callbacks in tests.
