//  CallTransport.swift
//  Conduit
//
//  The seam over the Pipecat iOS client. Concrete adapters (DailyTransport,
//  later LiveKitTransport) live in this folder and conform here; nothing outside
//  references an SDK type. The call engine drives a `CallTransport` and
//  consumes its `events`.
//
//  AUDIO-SESSION INVARIANT: a transport must NOT seize the microphone or activate
//  the audio session on its own. Media attaches only when the engine calls
//  `attachAudioSession()`, which it does only after CallKit's `providerDidActivate`.
//  CallKit owns the session; the transport attaches to it.
